A photo storing app developed using the avalonia framework, using axaml as the front end and c# as the back end.
I made this app because i was tired of losing my screenshots in games, so i decided to make something that would categorize my games in sections that i can easily check!
Currently a work in progress, i have a ton of ambitions for this app and alot more features to introduce!



##  üîê Getting Started
getting started you will be greeted with a basic login page.Each user will have their own database which stores the photos available to that user.

I plan to add Forogtten password to allow users to change passwords multiple times


### üéÆ The app
Once in the app youll get straight to the main use of it. finding your game screenshots. as you can see its quite basic right now, but as i work on it ill be adding multiple pages, and options for you to add your own games.
currently i play league roblox and poe so ive chosen screenshots from these 3 games.

Clicking on any image will ofcourse  will zoom in for a clear viewer. Currently working on options to delete and add photos on the app itself instead of using the codebase :).

To add an image you simply press the plus logo on the right side.
This opens up the file explorer allowing you to add an image downloaded on your pc.
