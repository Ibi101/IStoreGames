Simple overview of use/purpose.

## 
A photo storing app developed using the avalonia framework, using axaml as the front end and c# as the back end.
I made this app because i was tired of losing my screenshots in games, so i decided to make something that would categorize my games in sections that i can easily check!
Currently a work in progress, i have a ton of ambitions for this app and alot more features to introduce!



## Getting Started
getting started you will be greeted with a basic login page. i plan to make a database for each user to store their photos, but for now its just in files within the code-sapce so the login feature really isnt necessary.

I plan to add Forogtten password and sign up options to and maybe a little animation on the page.   


### The app
Once in the app youll get straight to the main use of it. finding your game screenshots. as you can see its quite basic right now, but as i work on it ill be adding multiple pages, and options for you to add your own games.
currently i play league roblox and poe so ive chosen screenshots from these 3 games.

Clicking on any image will ofcourse  will zoom in for a clear viewer. Currently working on options to delete and add photos on the app itself instead of using the codebase :).
